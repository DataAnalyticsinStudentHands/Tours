Like Argents other work, he takes something so recognizable and almost mundane and blows it up to a scale that you have to pay attention to and consider in a new light. These two hand-carved granite gourds and one bronze gourd sit atop a granite paver system also designed by Argent. They have an otherworldly presence like something out of a fairy tale. Argent is also very well known for his huge blue bear in Denver. "

What distinguishes his work from many modern sculptures is his refusal to carve the granite once he has hauled it from the quarries. He prefers working from pieces that suggest to him their final form and their relation to pre-historic entities. He desires to expose the stone to let people see it as it actually exists. Lotus offers a contrast of rough and smooth surfaces, it contains broken and unreflected color, the natural against the mechanical. It has a rhythm of grace, texture and form."

Carter’s artwork is inspired by numerous aspects of contemporary society: modes of transportation, mass communication devices, sports insignias, and architecture for mass gatherings like stadiums and parade grounds. His work makes reference to modernist artists in the early 20th century like Alexander Calder. Deeply rooted in a fascination with how visual abstract codes represent a means of communication, Carter’s free-form compositions are simultaneously non-objective and referential. "

Using geometric shapes, such as the cube, tetrahedron, and the pyramid, he has transformed them into poetic distortion.His sculptures appear to go against the very laws of gravity and float with grace.  Tower of Cheyenne is a 31’ Cor-ten sculpture fabricated from multiple welded segments. With its abstract simple form, its geometric shapes are suggestive of the patterns of Indian rugs and baskets. Its massiveness and its ambiguous balance reach into space with a repeating zig-zag pattern. The three primary vertical zig-zag segments are arranged in an equilateral triangle joined internally at sex points which if viewed from above or below create an additional zig-zag effect. The overall effect of the vertical and horizontal components is to create an almost infinite variety of repetitive closed internal and open external zig-zag shapes."

They are most known for suspended pieces made up of hundreds of individual parts hung at just the right heights to create bird, boat and human forms. UH is fortunate to have worked with this duo in their heyday. In 2000, they created Modulation, an enormous head measuring 12 feet high, 8 feet wide, 10 feet deep and suspended in the three story atrium lobby of the Leroy and Lucille Melcher Center for Public Broadcasting, home of KUHF Radio and Television. It is comprised of hundreds of discarded and 'antiquated' electronic parts like circuit boards, wires, cables, radio tubes, speakers and more all attached to a steel armature. The piece is active as well. Speakers transmit KUHF radio programs, fans spin, video monitors in the eyes display KUHF Television broadcasting. The interior of the head, which can be viewed by standing under it, holds an LED map of the Houston area. The face of Modulation has not specific gender or ethnicity; it is instead an amalgamation of multiple ethnic groups."

Howard’s work is inundated with a light and airy feeling, which seems to float in the space in which it is displayed."

This notion of heat is inclusive, conflating the heat of politics with the heat of conflicting relations between nations and peoples. The perception of heat waves, of meltdown, is reinforced by the implication of movement in his work-an amazing accomplishment for static images of the body. His figures imply action in the way they are modeled. Their bodies act against the strain of gravity and respond to the forces of time and weather."

A long time Houston resident, Jim Love grew up in Amarillo. As shy as his humor was wry, Love emerged in the early 1950s as one of the modernist rebels. Love's early works were made from objects found in scrap heaps. He welded and transformed items such as plumbing fixtures into fanciful birds, giant flowers and other creatures. He has said of his work that a piece begins with an idea when something 'strikes his fancy' which he then develops into sculpture. It comes from a creative imagination with a keen sense of the irony, absurdity and humor of life."

He poses them so naturally that they are people, not nudes. Some have repose and serenity while others have a sense of arrested motion that flow into a weightiness that satisfies sculpturally.Miller has said that he approaches the figure as a geometrical shape and is 'interested in the perception of form'. His works are seldom life size preferring the larger or smaller than life scale. Miller also likes to give his models props to work with as in the case of Sandy in Defined Space whose body is reacting to the confines of the square. Negative spaces between her body and the frame she is sitting in create a combination of 'soft' or suggestive, geometric spaces."

He instead will choose from existing works that best suit the site. His work has been described as monolithic as he exhibits a constant concern to compose within the size of the piece; yet, he is careful to observe its integrity. The essential action in his work is a turning, coiling and uncoiling movement, and a torsion which never breaks with the monolithic integrity of the sculpture. Perfectly contained in space Split Level invites the viewer to explore it from all angles; from its square tube beginning/end to the gentle 360 degree curve that frames the inviting center core. The works balance is intriguingand invites exploration from all sides."

Composed of lodestone, polished red granite and quartz, 'Kryptos' features thousands of letter characters containing encrypted messages. Only a handful of those messages have been cracked.'I wanted to choose text that would peak the interest of the people who view it,' Sanborn said. 'The issues that are discussed within the text have to do with relationships, and I feel many students can relate to that. I also hope students will interact with each other when translating some of the languages they are unfamiliar with.' The various texts range from Emily Dickinson to Rumi to Pablo Neruda. During the day the texts can be easily read on the screen and on the surface of the plaza. As the sun moves in its Southerly arc, the texts are clearly projected on the paving. At night, a built-in projector will shine light through the sculpture, reflecting the text onto the library’s exterior walls. In the library’s third-floor reading room, bronze panels along the guardrails also will contain portions of poems and other literature."

There are more than four 'lies' here, well not lies but intentional misinformation. It’s intended to be interactive, the figures are greeting you, come in, take a picture with them. There is also a time capsule in the wall to be opened at UH’s 100th anniversary and there is also an amazing Codex housed in the MD Anderson Library’s Special Collections."

With the help of a team of local artists, he opened a temporary studio in Houston to produce this large scale work. Euphonia is still the largest piece in the UH Collection in terms of scale and budget. It can be best described as a visual cacophony but in a good way.  The lobby of the Opera House has a large 100 foot long barrel vaulted ceiling which Stella covered with a collage of abstracted imagery and patterns. This same imagery and collage technique is also used on the very large scale triptych on the mezzanine level just off the lobby measuring 10 feet tall and 72 feet wide in total. In addition, Stella created another piece on the underside on the catwalk inside the Opera House. Euphonia truly is a gem of the UH Collection."

Learn and live nothing but the truth and the whole truth, for all and once, over and over… ever and forever. Shine and Rise is a fully realized example of this more baroque style with radiating lines emanating from behind the word 'truth',  ironic maybe but thoughtful indeed. Shine and Rise is a collection of clichéd phrases and idioms strung together and reversed to cause the viewer to see, read and consider them in a new context. The banner begins on the left panel, crisscrosses the entire surface, turning upside down, curling on itself and trailing off ending on the right panel. It floats in this space in such a way that letters and words are revealed and concealed requiring the viewer to complete the phrases. The whole piece is meant to be an inspirational verse created specifically for the students of the Honors College."

In either instance, the result is simplicity, one that is informed by Wall’s interest in Zen philosophy and Japanese calligraphy."

Wallen is a sculptor and printmaker from Juneau, Alaska. He has been celebrating Alaska in drawings, paintings and stone lithographs since its territorial days.The life-like quality of the sculptures was due in part to The University of Houston’s Nancy Hixon borrowing for Wallen a cougar skull with dentia (felis concolor) from the Texas Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences at Texas A&M University. Additionally, Wallen spent time sketching and photographing two live cougars in order better understand their movement and muscularity. His primary models were a brother and sister cougar that resided at the MacKenzie Environmental Center in Poynette, Wisconsin."
